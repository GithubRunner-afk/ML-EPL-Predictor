# Predicting EPL match outcomes with Machine Learning

 This project uses a large data sets and uses multiple criterion for AI to help predict the outcome of matches.
 Currently, it has a roughly 65% accuracy. However, if a larger data set were available, it could go up in accuracy, or lower due the change of times and player transfers


## The Algorithm

The algorithm uses multiple different criterion, such as goals scored, goals scored on, previous records of matches against the team, the time of day ( accounting for possible fatigue), form ( looks at your record for the past 3 matches ), and more. It uses these criterion to predict who would win the match ( 1 ) or draw/lose the match ( 0 )

## Running this project

1. Run this code in a notebook. I am linking a python project for mainly notes, and use the notebook to actually run the program. prediction notebook and just click run all. Then you can tinker with some of the code lines I put below.
2. If you want to look further in the data besides arsenal and wolves, use: combined.head(___) and fiddle with the number in the parentheses

Something you can do to extend this project:
Add more criterion for the ML
Add additional data from more seasons.
Try different leagues!
